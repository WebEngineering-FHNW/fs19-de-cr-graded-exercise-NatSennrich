# WebEngineering Module, Graded Exercise

## Commit Proposal

Matriculation Number: 17-548-397

Project idea short description: 
Platform for control of orders in restaurant
Expectations: 1 page for create new orders or modify orders which have not been
canceled yet (consumer is still in the restaurant) and 1 page with the day overview
(all orders of one specified date).

## Project confirmation

Either you put _create_, _edit_ and _delete_ on one single page (aka single-page app, with some **JavaScript**). Or you will need one page for each operation. You might start. Good luck!
